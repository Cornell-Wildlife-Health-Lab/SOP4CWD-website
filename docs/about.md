# Welcome to the Surveillance Optimization Project for Chronic Wasting Disease

The Surveillance Optimization Project for Chronic wasting disease (CWD) was started in 2020 to address the needs of wildlife agencies across North America. 

## What is CWD? 

CWD is a fatal disease of white-tailed deer and other cervid species. Since 1967, when the disease was first discovered in captive mule deer in Colorado, CWD has spread across North America. To protect native North American cervid populations, wildlife agencies are trying to slow the spread of the disease and prevent introduction to new areas. However, these goals have proven extremely difficult.

## Responding to the Challenge

Disease surveillance, including efforts to detect new introductions quickly and measure changes in disease prevalence in areas where it exists, is an essential component of the disease response plans enacted by wildlife agencies across North America. 

But where should wildlife agencies focus their efforts?

How much sampling is enough to determine if an area is ‘free of disease’ or to determine if the prevalence is increasing or decreasing?

What does an efficient and effective disease surveillance plan look like?

## Enter SOP4CWD

We started the Surveillance Optimization Project for Chronic Wasting Disease (SOP4CWD) to address these questions and provide wildlife agencies with quantitative tools. SOP4CWD collaborators are applying methods from mathematical modeling and data science to address the challenges of disease surveillance by merging analytical techniques, including risk weighting, Bayesian modeling, and geospatial analysis, with machine learning algorithms.
