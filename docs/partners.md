# Project Partners 
SOP4CWD would not be possible without the array of partners who have stepped up to support this ambitious effort. 

## Agency Partners
Data and input from participating wildlife agencies play a key role in the CWD Data Warehouse. More than 2-dozen wildlife agencies have participate in SOP4CWD or contributed to the development of the CWD Data Warehouse. By engaging and contributing to the CWD Data Warehouse, wildlife agencies ensure that technologies and modeling products are relevant to wildlife health and can be integrated into existing surveillance programs.

Collaboration with partnering agencies is jointly led by professionals at the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab and Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Michigan State University. 

## Technological Partners
Development of the technology behind the CWD Data Warehouse is led by professionals in theÂ Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, with application development completed by DJ Case. We further coordinate with programmers to incorporate models into the CWD Data Warehouse. 

## Modeling Partners
The Quantitative Group consists of a growing assortment of self-selected interdisciplinary people from all backgrounds of quantitative analysis or wildlife health. Containing researchers across departments, institutions, sciences, and countries, the diverse perspectives and skills in this group continue to produce [**cutting edge tools**](./warehouse/team/Publications.md) to aid in CWD surveillance. 

## Financial Partners
Since project inception in 2020, various components of SOP4CWD have been funded in part by state wildlife agencies, including the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Alabama Department of Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Additional funding has been secured through competitive grants from multiple agencies at the federal level.
