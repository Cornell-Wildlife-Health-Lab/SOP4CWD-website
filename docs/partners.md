# Partners

Interagency data sharing is a principle aim of the Warehouse design. Sharing data and information across jurisdictional boundaries is critical for situational awareness and developing a deeper understanding of CWD to support better data-driven decisions.

Data and input from participating wildlife agencies play a key role in SOP4CWD and the CWD Data Warehouse. More than 20 wildlife agencies participate in SOP4CWD and have contributed to the development of the CWD Data Warehouse. Wildlife agencies also share important information about their CWD surveillance programs. By engaging and contributing to the CWD Data Warehouse, wildlife agencies ensure that the analyses and products are relevant and can be integrated into existing surveillance programs. Additional tools and visualizations can be added to the Warehouse to meet the evolving needs of wildlife agencies.

SOP4CWD has been funded by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and is jointly led by the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab and the Boone and Crockett Quantitative Wildlife Center at Michigan State University. The United States Geological Survey and University of California–Davis contribute to the project as research partners.

The CWD Data Warehouse project is led by the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab. The application development team at DJ Case has managed the technical development of the system.

The SOP4CWD wildlife health statistics and modeling team consists of a growing assortment of self-selected interdisciplinary people from all backgrounds of quantitative analysis. Containing researchers across departments, institutions, and countries, the diverse perspectives and skills in this group have produced cutting edge tools to aid in CWD surveillance and management.
