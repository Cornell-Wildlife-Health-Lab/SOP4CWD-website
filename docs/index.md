          <h2>CWD, Meet Data Science</h2>
          <p>Chronic wasting disease is spreading in deer populations across North America. How can data science, technology, and modeling help agencies understand and respond to this disease? SOP4CWD is here to help.</p><br>

          <h2>Putting the Needs of WIldlife Agencies First</h2>
          <p>Collaboration and coordination are critically important if we are to successfully combat this disease. Through SOP4CWD, researchers (including data scientists, disease ecologists, and statisticians) are working closely with wildlife agencies to generate the tools and resources they need. All wildlife agencies are welcome to join our effort, as are researchers who may be able to provide expertise and develop new solutions.</p><br>

          <h2>The CWD Data Warehouse</h2>
          <p>The CWD Data Warehouse is an shared online platform for wildlife agencies, providing easy access to advanced modeling and analytics that directly address their information needs and help them conduct efficient and effective disease surveillance. The Warehouse also serves as a one stop shop for CWD data management, analysis, and data sharing.</p><br>
