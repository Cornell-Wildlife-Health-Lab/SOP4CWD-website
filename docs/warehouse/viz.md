# **Visualizations**

The Visualizations component includes data visualization, reporting, and dashboarding functionality and allows an agency to summarize their data, explore model outputs, and convey information to their staff. A single visualization may contain one or more elements, such as tables, charts, and maps.

Some visualizations have specific purposes and require specific data or model executions. These include visualizations designed for model exploration (such as the Risk-weighted Surveillance Quotas Model Visualization) or for helping an agency track surveillance progress during a sampling period (the Surveillance Activity Visualization).

Ad hoc visualizations allow an agency more flexibility to present their data visually on a map, including the ability to create regional maps. For example, you can look at whether, where, and how much your neighbors are sampling (for jurisdictions that are part of the project and have uploaded data).
