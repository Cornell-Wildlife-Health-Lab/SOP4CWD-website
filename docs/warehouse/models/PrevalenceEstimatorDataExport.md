# Prevalence Estimator Data Export

The Prevalence Estimator Data Export allows users to pre-process CWD Data Warehouse sample data for upload and use in the [SpeedGoat Estimation Tool](https://public.spdgt.com/app/wtsurv){target="_blank"} to estimate underlying CWD prevalence after sampling has been completed and no positive cases were found. Of particular interest is the upper bound of the credible interval, which means there is, for example, a 95% probability that true prevalence is at or below the reported level given your sampling effort and lack of cases detected.
