# Models

The CWD Data Warehouse allows agencies to analyze data using models, software that intakes agency data and parameters and generates outputs. The model could be as simple as a data summary or as complex as a high-dimensional spatial analysis. Results of models help wildlife agencies efficiently plan CWD surveillance efforts and make data-driven decisions. 

## Available models 

The [**Risk-weighted Surveillance Quotas Model**](RiskWeightedSurveillanceQuotasModel.md) incorporates risk factors for CWD to calculate surveillance point quotas per management unit. It is particularly applicable to states/provinces that have not yet detected CWD.

The [**Epizootic Risk Model**](EpizooticRiskModel.md) helps agencies decide where to sample and allows exploration of methods to reduce the epizootic potential of CWD.

The [**Prevalence Estimator Data Export**](PrevalenceEstimatorDataExport.md) function processes sample data for upload into an external app to estimate the maximum prevalence of CWD in areas for which no positive cases were found after sampling has been completed.

The [**Sample Size for Multiple Groups**](FreedomFromDiseaseClusteredPopulation.md) is used to determine the sample size needed to declare a population free from disease given that hosts naturally cluster (and share disease) on the landscape. 

The [**Disease Cluster Analysis Data Export**](DiseaseClusterAnalysisDataExport.md) function processes sample data for upload into an external app to determine if disease clusters are present or if disease is randomly distributed over time or space.
 
## In Development

The SOP4CWD [modeling team](../../modeling.md) is continually working on developing new models to help wildlife agencies create sound, data-driven CWD surveillance, management, and response plans.
