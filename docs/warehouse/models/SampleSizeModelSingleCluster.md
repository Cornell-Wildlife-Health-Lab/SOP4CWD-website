# Sample Size Model for a Single Cluster (*in development*)

The Sample Size Model for a Single Cluster is used to plan a sampling scheme to investigate disease prevalence in a single naturally-occurring biological group that has correlated disease status.

## Geographical Scale: 
* Biological cluster of interest

## Required Data: 
* None

## Suggested Data: 
* None

## User Inputs: 
* Cluster size
* Correlation of disease status within cluster

## Outputs: 
* The number of samples needed in the population of interest to ensure there is a high probability that disease prevalence is at or below 1%.
