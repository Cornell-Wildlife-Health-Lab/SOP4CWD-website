* Perform geographical surveillance of disease, to detect spatial or space-time disease clusters and to see if they are statistically significant
* Test whether a disease is randomly distributed over space, time, or space and time
* Evaluate the statistical significance of disease cluster alarms

## Geographical Scale: 
* Exact locations of deer

## Required Data: 
* Sample data, including exact latitude and longitude and harvest date

## Suggested Data: 
* None

## User Inputs: 
* Cervid species
* Season-years(s)
* Scan type (spatial or temporal)

## Outputs: 
* A downloadable file of processed sample data for use in the SaTScan import wizard.
