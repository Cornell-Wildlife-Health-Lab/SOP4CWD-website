# Disease Cluster Analysis Data Export
*Deployed*

The Disease Cluster Analysis Data Export allows users to pre-process CWD Warehouse sample data for immediate upload into the [SaTScan software](https://www.satscan.org/){target="_blank"}. The SaTScan software analyzes spatial and temporal data for any of the following interrelated purposes:

* Perform geographical surveillance of disease
* Detect spatial or space-time disease clusters
* Test whether a disease is randomly distributed over space, time, or space and time
* Evaluate the statistical significance of disease clusters

## Geographical Scale
* A collection of exact locations of hosts (latitude, longitude)

## Required Data
* Sample data, including exact latitude/longitude and exact harvest date

## User Inputs
* Cervid species of interest
* Season-years(s) of interest
* Desired scan type (spatial or temporal)

## Outputs
* A downloadable file of processed sample data for use in the SaTScan import wizard
* A downloadable file with a summary of Warehouse-selected inputs to assist in model creation in the SaTScan software
