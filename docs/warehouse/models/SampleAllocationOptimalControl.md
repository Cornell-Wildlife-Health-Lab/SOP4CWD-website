# Sample Allocation using Optimal Control Model (*in development*)

The Sample Allocation using Optimal Control Model leverages cost and introduction risk to pinpoint the best surveillance strategy across many administrative areas that are not known to harbor CWD.

## Geographical Scale
* Sub-administrative areas

## Required Data
* Cost-per-sample data
* The ability to run the Risk-weighted Surveillance Quotas Model

## User Inputs
* Annual budget

## Outputs
* A map containing the intensity of sampling needed in each sub-administrative area.
* A graph showing the budget necessary to enter the turnpike.
