# **Epizootic Risk Model**

The Epizootic Risk Model depicts areas for which local demographic parameters of the live cervid population influence the spread of CWD once infectious prions are introduced. It allows you to prioritize surveillance in areas with high risk of an explosive outbreak. 

## Geographical Scale: 
* Sub-administrative area

## Required Data: 
* Sample data

## Suggested Data: 
* Demography data (e.g., density, fecundity, mortality)

## User Inputs: 
* Cervid species
* Estimates of demographic factors (if data are unavailable)
* Estimates of epidemiological factors

## Outputs: 
* Estimates of the Epizootic Potential and Population Growth rate
* Comparative maps by sub-administrative area
* Data charts by sub-administrative area
* Comparative tables by sub-administrative area
