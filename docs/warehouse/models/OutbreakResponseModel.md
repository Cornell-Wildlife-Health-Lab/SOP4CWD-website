# Outbreak Response Model
*In final QA/QC prior to deployment*

The Outbreak Response Model is used after the first case of CWD is confirmed to draw a spatial containment zone around the outbreak and determine where best to deploy management actions within the zone.

## Geographical Scale
* Outbreak containment zone centered around a real or hypothetical CWD+ host

## Required Data
* Sample data

## User Inputs
* Area of interest (if host is hypothetical) 
* Probability of direct or indirect contact to be modeled
* Summary type
* Sample source
* Season of interest

## Outputs
* An integrated risk surface meshing contact probabilities with resource selection functions to view where the index case may have spread disease to other free-ranging hosts
