title: Sample Size for declaring freedom from disease in a clustered population
description: Infectious disease model for population health

# Sample Size for Multiple Groups

This model estimates the sample size needed to substantiate declaring that a population has freedom from a given disease, explicitly accounting for biological clusterings within the overall population.

## Geographical Scale
* Biological population of interest (N)

## Required Data
* None

## Suggested Data
* None

## User Inputs
* Total population size estimate
* Average cluster size
* Correlation of disease status within cluster
* Diagnostic test sensitivity 

## Outputs
* The number of animals that need to be tested to have high probability (95%) that disease prevalence in the overall population is at or below 1% or 2%.
