# Disease Control Strategies Model
*In development*

The Disease Control Strategies Model is used to compare management strategies that may be used to control an outbreak of CWD among free-ranging hosts.

## Geographical Scale
* 10 km x 10 km

## Required Data
* Sample data
* Demographic data (specifically harvest data)


## User Inputs
* Location of outbreak
* Season-year of interest

## Outputs
* Histograms showing number of hosts exposed to CWD given each candidate management strategy
* Plots depicting the number of hosts exposed to CWD within each candidate strategy arising from environmental, disease, and host forces
* The best strategy (or combinations of strategies) to attenuate CWD outbreak
