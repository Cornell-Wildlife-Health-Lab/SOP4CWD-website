# Disease Control Strategies Model (*in development*)

The Disease Control Strategies Model is used to compare and contrast management strategies to control a CWD outbreak.

## Geographical Scale: 
* 10 km x 10 km

## Required Data: 
* Sample data
* Geospatial data
* Demographic data
* Harvest data

## Suggested Data: 
* None

## User Inputs: 
* Location of outbreak
* Season-year

## Outputs: 
* Histograms that show the number of deer exposed to CWD given each candidate management strategy
* Plots that show the number of deer exposed to CWD relative to environmental, disease, and host agents within a management strategy
* The best strategy (or combinations of strategies) to attenuate CWD outbreak
