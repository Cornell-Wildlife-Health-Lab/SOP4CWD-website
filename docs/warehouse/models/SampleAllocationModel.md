# Sample Allocation Model 
*In development*

The Sample Allocation Model (SAM) uses pioneering methods in optimal control theory to balance surveillance cost with introduction probability in each sub-administrative area to pinpoint the best possible surveillance strategy across the entire administrative area. SAM is also useful in determining the probability that a sub-administrative area is disease-free given up to three years of historical sampling intensity without finding a positive case.

## Geographical Scale
* Administrative area, subdivided into a sub-administrative areas

## Required Data
* Average surveillance cost-per-sample in each sub-administrative area 
* The ability to run the Risk-Weighted Surveillance Quotas Model to obtain introduction probabilities

## User Inputs
* Annual budget of the surveillance program across the entire administrative area

## Outputs
* A map containing the probability that each sub-administrative area is disease-free 
* A map containing the intensity of sampling needed in each sub-administrative area to achieve optimal control
* A graph showing the annual budget necessary to shorten the time till first detection
