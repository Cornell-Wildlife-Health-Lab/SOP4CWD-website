# Home Range Contamination Model (*in development*)

The Home Range Contamination Model is used to determine which home ranges are likely to harbor CWD-positive hosts.

## Geographical Scale: 
* Home range of user-specified sizes (default = 6 sq. km) 

## Required Data: 
* Sample data, with latitude longitude locations
* Geospatial data


## Suggested Data: 
* None

## User Inputs: 
* Cervid species
* Season-year

## Outputs: 
* A map that shows risk of CWD detection by home range and age/sex segment.
