# Home Range Contamination Model
*In development*

The Home Range Contamination Model is used to determine which home ranges are likely to harbor CWD-positive hosts.

## Geographical Scale
* Home range of user-specified sizes with a default of 6 sq. km

## Required Data
* Sample data, with both positive and negative hosts, all with exact latitude and longitude locations

## User Inputs
* Cervid species of interest
* Season-year of interest

## Outputs
* A map showing the probability by age and sex segment that any given home range will harbor a CWD positive host
