# Simple Prevalence Estimator (*in development*)

The Simple Prevalence Estimator allows the user to estimate underlying CWD prevalence after sampling has been completed and no positive cases were found. Unlike the Prevalence Estimator Data Export, which allows the user to use the SpeedGoat Estimation Tool, the Simple Prevalence Estimator does not require age/sex information in your sample data.

## Geographical Scale
* Sub-administrative area

## Required Data
* Sample data, including sub-administrative areas without any detected CWD for the selected species and season-year(s)

## Suggested Data
* None

## User Inputs
* Cervid species
* Season-year

## Outputs
* An estimate of the underlying prevalence based on one year of sampling intensity.
