# Risk-Weighted Surveillance Quotas Model
*Deployed*

The Risk-Weighted Surveillance Quotas Model incorporates risk factors for CWD, including anthropogenic (human-related) and demographic (host population) forces to calculate surveillance quotas per sub-administrative area. Surveillance targets can be used by agencies to plan upcoming surveillance across a region, state, province, or nation.

## Geographical Scale
* Administrative area, subdivided into a sub-administrative areas

## Required Data
* Deer demography data

## Suggested Data
* Cervid facility data
* Taxidermist data
* Meat processor data

## User Inputs
* The number of surveillance points achievable for the entire administrative area 
* Surveillance categories for each sub-administrative area

## Outputs
* Surveillance quotas by sub-administrative area
* Comparative maps of quotas by surveillance category
* Risk profiles of each sub-administrative area
* Charts and comparative tables of quotas and risks
