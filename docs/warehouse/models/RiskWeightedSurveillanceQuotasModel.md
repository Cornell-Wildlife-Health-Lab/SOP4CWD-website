# Risk-Weighted Surveillance Quotas Model

The Risk-Weighted Surveillance Quotas Model incorporates risk factors for CWD, including anthropogenic (human-related) and demographic (deer population) forces, to calculate surveillance point quotas per sub-administrative area that can be used by agencies in their surveillance plans.

## Geographical Scale
* Sub-administrative area

## Required Data
* Deer demography data

## Suggested Data
* Cervid facility data
* Taxidermist data
* Meat processor data

## User Inputs
* Surveillance point total for administrative area 
* Surveillance categories for sub-administrative areas

## Outputs
* Surveillance quotas by sub-administrative area
* Comparative maps by surveillance category
* Risk scores and total quotas
* Data charts and comparative tables
