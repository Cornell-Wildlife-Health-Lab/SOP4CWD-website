# Western Expansion of the Risk-weighted Surveillance Quotas Model (*in development*)

The Western Expansion of the Risk-weighted Surveillance Quotas Model incorporates risk factors for CWD specific to western landscapes, including anthropogenic (human-related) and demographic (deer population) forces, to calculate surveillance point quotas per sub-administrative area that can be used by agencies in their surveillance plans.

## Geographical Scale
* Sub-administrative area

## Required Data
* TBD

## Suggested Data
* TBD

## User Inputs
* TBD

## Outputs
* Surveillance quotas by sub-administrative area
* Comparative maps by surveillance category
* Risk scores and total quotas
* Data charts and comparative tables
