# Positive Predictor Model
*In development*

The Positive Predictor Model uses machine learning in conjunction with all available continent-wide CWD data to predict which sub-administrative areas may turn CWD-positive in upcoming years.

## Geographical Scale
* Administrative area, subdivided into a sub-administrative areas

## Required Data
* Sample data
* Cervid facility data

## Suggested Data
* Demography data
* Taxidermist data
* Meat processor data

## User Inputs
* Season-year

## Outputs
* A map containing the predictions of CWD emergence for each sub-administrative area in your administrative area
