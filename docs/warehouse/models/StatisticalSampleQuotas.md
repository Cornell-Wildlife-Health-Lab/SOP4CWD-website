# Statistical Sample Quotas using Clustering

This model estimates the sample size needed in each subadministrative unit without finding disease to have high probability that prevalence is at or below a threshold. The model explicitly accounts for biological clusterings in the population.

## Geographical Scale
* Sub-administrative area

## Required Data
* Population size or population density

## User Inputs
* Average cluster size
* Correlation
* Sensitivity of the diagnostic test

## Outputs
* The number of animals that need to be tested in each subadministrative unit to have high probability (95%) that disease prevalence in the overall population is at or below 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3%, 4%, or 5%.
