# **CWD Data Warehouse Supporting Documents**

All state, provincial, and tribal wildlife agencies are required to approve the CWD Data Warehouse Data Use Agreement & Terms of Use (DUA) prior to accessing and using the Warehouse. The DUA is an important document that establishes the data sharing relationship between wildlife agencies and the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, which developed, administers, and manages the Warehouse. The DUA defines how agency data in the Warehouse can and cannot be used and establishes who can access the data and in what capacity.
