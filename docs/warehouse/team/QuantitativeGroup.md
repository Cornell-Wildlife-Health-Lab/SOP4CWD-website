# Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

## Join the Group
We invite all professionals with an interest in wildlife health surveillance to meet us virtually at 3-4pm ET each week. We discuss the most pressing questions in CWD data, prevention, surveillance, and management, then construct models to answer these questions. No previous statistical or modeling experience necessary!

      <h3>Noelle Thompson</h3>
      <p>Noelle is the leader of the quantitative group. She is the interagency wildlife health specialist for the <a href="https://wafwa.org/" target="_blank">Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies</a>. She earned her PhD in Fisheries and Wildlife with a concentration in disease ecology and conservation medicine at Michigan State University. Her research has focused on chronic wasting disease modeling and management, but her interests range broadly in the ecology and modeling of infectious diseases and decision analysis. She is always eager to collaborate on wildlife health projects.</p>
