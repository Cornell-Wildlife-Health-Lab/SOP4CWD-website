<figcaption>Jim is the Department Chair and a Professor in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University, 
one of three departments in Computing and Information Science. He joined the group in 2020 and has already revolutionized the 
way we think about sampling wildlife for disease, specifically by considering natural clustering behavior. Attributing his 
success to watching the deer in his backyard, Jim continues to be modest despite the fact that we all want him to win the Nobel Prize. </figcaption></center>

machine learning, and reinforcement learning to transform data into quantitative insights for policymaking. His current work is primarily 
applied to sustainable operations, with a particular context in biodiversity conservation.</figcaption></center>

<center>![Beatriz Martínez-López](../assets/Beatriz.jpg)
<figcaption>Beatriz is a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the Department of Medicine & Epidemiology, Veterinary School, University of California - Davis 
and Director of the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS, https://cadms.vetmed.ucdavis.edu) since January 2014, a recognized 
FAO Reference Center for Veterinary Epidemiology. She has more than 150 publications related with the development and implementation of quantitative 
methods such as epidemiological modeling, risk assessment, geostatistical methods or network analysis to unravel complex epidemiological problems 
at the wild-domestic-human interface. Currently, she is leading the development, implementation and validation of novel Big Data analytical and 
visualization tools and their integration into operational, web-based, user-friendly platforms such as the Disease BioPortal (http://bioportal.ucdavis.edu/) 
to more timely support animal health decisions in livestock and aquaculture industries. She currently teaches mostly graduate 
courses such as “Applied Epidemiology Problem solving”, “Infectious Disease Epidemiology”, “Health and Ecological Risk Analysis” and “Spatial 
Epidemiology”, mainly offered to students in the Master of Preventive Veterinary Medicine (MPVM), the Master of Public 
Health (MPH) and the Graduate Group of Epidemiology (GGE), although other students from other graduate groups are also welcome. She 
currently mentors more than 15 graduate and undergraduate students and participates annually in several training and technology transfer 
activities with veterinary services or public health departments in many different countries.</figcaption></center>

<center>![Hunter Reed](../assets/Hunter.jpg)
<figcaption>Hunter received his veterinary degree from Cornell University and his Master’s of Public Health degree from the University of 
Minnesota. Currently, he is a Wildlife Veterinarian for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) where he investigates a 
wide array of wildlife disease issues across Texas in addition to assisting with wildlife health policy, rule development, and research. 
Prior to working for TPWD, he also worked at Texas Animal Health Commission as a Field Epidemiologist investigating disease issues 
in Texas livestock, primarily focusing on chronic wasting disease and cattle fever ticks. Using his varied on-the-ground knowledge of 
disease topics as well as his working relationships with governmental, academic, and private entities, he seeks to support the 
long-term conservation of wildlife resources in Texas and across the country.</figcaption></center>
