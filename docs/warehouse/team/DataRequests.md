# Access Agency Data for Research
A principle aim of the CWD Data Warehouse is to facilitate the sharing of data with researchers engaged model development. Interested researchers can use publicly available historic SOP4CWD data sets as well as request additional recent private data from participating agencies.

## Access Open Historical Data
Data obtained from wildlife agencies at the start of SOP4CWD was published as open data under an earlier research DUA. These historical data sets are readily available in the Cornell eCommons online digital data repository.

## Request Access to Private Recent Data
Partnering agencies continue to generate and push new CWD data into the CWD Data Warehouse. ResearchersÂ may use a <a href="https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/CWHL/CWD-Data-Warehouse/terms-and-conditions.html#research-approval-plan" target="_blank">Researcher Request Form</a> to request access to these data to conduct CWD research or develop new CWD models.

Interested researchers must submit a research proposal that describes the project, including the research objective and methods, specific data required, a data security plan, and expected outcomes. Proposals then go through an approval process involving the source agency. Once a proposal is approved by the source agency, Warehouse administrators will extract the data from the Warehouse and securely transmit it to the researcher. Researchers are required to adhere to agreement with the source entity that defines how the data can and cannot be used.

Interested researchers are encouraged to contact SOP4CWD for more information.
