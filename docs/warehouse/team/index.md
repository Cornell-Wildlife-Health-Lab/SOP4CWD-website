# Facilitating Scientific Discovery
There are several avenues in which SOP4CWD is advancing scientific understanding of CWD and increasing the role of quantiative sciences in wildlife health investigation. The SOP4CWD team:

* Publishes all research products in open source journals and repositories 
* Maintains the Wildlife Health Quantitative Group, which adapts current models or invents new tools to support agencies in answering their most pressing CWD-related questions
* Coordinates researcher data request forms to link modelers with agencies
* Encourages any modeler to incorporate their model into the CWD Data Warehouse to increase its use by agency professionals
* Shares project experience and lessons learned across the wildlife health community
