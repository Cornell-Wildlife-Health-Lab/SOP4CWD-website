# Facilitating Scientific Discovery


## Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

We have a wildlife health quantitative group that meets remotely most Thursdays at 3pm ET to discuss current and new modeling approached to advance wildlife health. 
The goal of the group is to provide wildlife agencies with the quantitative tools they need to answer the most pressing questions in wildlife health and disease surveillance. 
Once models have undergone peer review to ensure scientific integrity, our team works to embed or link them to the CWD Data Warehouse to enable agencies to use the models with their own data to inform their CWD surveillance and management decisions.

## Join the Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

Please contact us for details if you'd like to join the modeling group. We welcome all professionals with an interest in wildlife health. No previous statistical experience necessary! 

## Contribute Published Models to the CWD Data Warehouse 

Once models have undergone peer review to ensure scientific integrity, modelers are invited to contribute CWD models for use in the Warehouse. 
We them work with the modeler to embed or link models to the CWD Data Warehouse to enable agencies to use the models with their own data.

## Request Data from the CWD Data Warehouse 

Modelers not affiliated with the group can still request data from the CWD Data Warehouse through a researcher request form. Data requests are considered by the source agency, and if authorized by the owners of the data, then requests are filled for the intended research. 

## Publications from the Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

The SOP4CWD collaboration publishes its work in the form of peer-reviewed manuscripts, code for models, and open source data sets. Models that appear in the CWD Data Warehouse are based on published manuscripts.
