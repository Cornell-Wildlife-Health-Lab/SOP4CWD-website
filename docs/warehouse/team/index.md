# Facilitating Scientific Discovery

## Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

A wildlife health quantitative group meets remotely most Thursdays at 3pm ET to discuss current and new modeling approached to advance scientific discovery in wildlife health. 
The goal of the group is to adapt current or develop new models to provide wildlife agencies with the quantitative tools they need to answer the most pressing questions in wildlife disease surveillance. 

Once new models have undergone peer review to ensure scientific integrity, our team works to embed or link them to the CWD Data Warehouse to enable agencies to use the models with their own data.

## Contribute Published Models to the CWD Data Warehouse 

You need not be a member of the quantitative group to contribute your published model to the CWD Data Warehouse. 

Contact us to discuss how to link your previously published model to the Warehouse to facilitate its use with real data by wildlife practitioners.

## Request Data from the CWD Data Warehouse 

Modelers not affiliated with the wildlife health quantitative group can still request data from the CWD Data Warehouse through a researcher request form. 
Data requests are considered by the source agency, and if authorized, requests are filled for use in the intended research.

## Publications from the Wildlife Health Quantitative Group

The SOP4CWD collaboration publishes its work in the form of peer-reviewed manuscripts, sharable code for models, and open source data sets.
