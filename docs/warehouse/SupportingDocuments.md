## Data Use Agreement (DUA)
Wildlife agencies in states, provinces, and indigenous nations are required to approve the Data Use Agreement & Terms of Use (DUA) prior to using the (non-Sandbox version) of the CWD Data Warehouse. The DUA is an important document that establishes the data sharing relationship between wildlife agencies and the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, who develop, administrate, and manage the CWD Data Warehouse. The DUA defines how agency data in the Warehouse can and cannot be used and establishes who can access the data and in what capacity.
