# Research

A principle aim of the CWD Data Warehouse is to facilitate the sharing of data with researchers engaged in developing novel methods to obtain a deeper understanding of CWD and to support better data-driven decisions for CWD surveillance and management. Researchers can use publicly shared SOP4CWD data sets as well as request additional data from multiple agencies using a single request to the CWD Data Warehouse.


## Open Data

Data obtained from wildlife agencies at the start of the SOP4CWD collaboration and used in the development of models have been published as open data in Cornell eCommons online data repository. These historical data sets are readily available for download and use by researchers.

## Data Requests

Agencies continue to generate new CWD surveillance data into the CWD Data Warehouse. Researchers may request these data from the CWD Data Warehouse to conduct CWD research or develop CWD models to be used by wildlife agencies within the Warehouse.

Interested researchers must submit a research proposal that describes the project, including the research objective and methods, specific data required, a data security plan, and expected outcomes.

Proposals go through an approval process. Once a proposal is approved by the wildlife agencies to which the data belong, Warehouse administrators will extract the data from the Warehouse and securely transmit it to the researcher. Researchers are required to adhere to a data use agreement that defines how the data can and cannot be used.

Interested researchers are encouraged to contact SOP4CWD for more information.
