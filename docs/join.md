# Become a SOP4CWD Partner!

## Wildlife Agencies

All North American state (US and Mexico), provincial (Canada), and tribal wildlife agencies are welcome to join the CWD Data Warehouse at no cost to them. The more partners we have, the stronger and better the outcomes of this effort will be.

In general, partner wildlife agencies joining the project are expected to be active and engaged partners by maintaining their CWD surveillance and ancillary data in the Warehouse. This includes best available CWD sampling and test data; population demographics; specific CWD introduction risks; historic population management activities and hunting data; and current surveillance program activities.

All participating agencies must approve the CWD Data Warehouse Data Use Agreement (DUA) prior to accessing and using the Warehouse. The DUA establishes the data sharing relationship and defines how agency data in the Warehouse can and cannot be used.

## Modelers and Researchers

The landscape of CWD is constantly changing necessitating ongoing research into how to predict where it will emerge and manage outbreaks. CWD modelers and researchers are welcome to join the SOP4CWD collaboration to help address these challenges and to benefit from the wealth of data stored in the CWD Data Warehouse. The only prerequisite for joining the wildlife health statistics and modeling team is the willingness to aid in the development of novel tools that will simultaneously advance the science of wildlife health and meet the urgent needs of our agency partners.
