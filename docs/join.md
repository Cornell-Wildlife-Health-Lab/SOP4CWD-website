# Join the Project by Becoming a Partner
Partnership in any capacity of SOP4CWD is free and open to anyone wishing to contribute to the science, learn new methods, meet new people, or contribute time, energy, or data to benefit everyone in this shared fight against CWD.  

## Contribute Wildlife Agency Data
All wildlife agencies in states (US and Mexico), provinces (Canada), and indigenous nations (North America) are welcome to join the CWD Data Warehouse at no cost. The more partners we have, the stronger and better the outcomes of this effort will be.

In general, wildlife agencies that join SOP4CWD are expected to be active and engaged by maintaining their CWD data in the Warehouse. This includes best available CWD sampling and test data; population demographics; specific CWD introduction risks; historic population management activities and hunting data; and current surveillance program activities. 

To whatever extent schedules allow, partnering agency representatives are further welcome to engage with modelers at our weekly Quantitative Group meetings to discuss questions, models, ideas, and to engage as coauthors on resulting scientific manuscripts. 

## Engage as a Developer
Ample opportunities exist to learn how to prepare mathematical and statistical models in a container environment for deployment into the CWD Data Warehouse. The benefit of this task is that models are made more readily available for use by agencies with their own data, expanding the reach of the model and its benefit to the scientific and management community.  

## Co-Develop Tools that are New to Science
The landscape of CWD is constantly changing, so models to predict emergence and help manage outbreaks must keep apace with advances in modeling advances. CWD modelers and researchers from any entity are welcome to join the SOP4CWD collaboration to help build models and address challenges. The only prerequisite for joining the Quantitative Group is the willingness to aid in the development of novel tools that will simultaneously advance the science of wildlife health and meet the urgent needs of our agency partners.
